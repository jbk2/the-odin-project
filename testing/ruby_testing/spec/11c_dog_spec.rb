# The file order to complete this lesson:

# 1. Familiarize yourself with the three lib/11 files.
#    - lib/11a_pet.rb is the parent 'Pet' class of 'Cat' and 'Dog'
#    - lib/11b_cat.rb is a subclass 'Cat'
#    - lib/11c_dog.rb is a subclass 'Dog'
# 2. Review the tests in spec/11a_shared_example_spec.rb
# 3. Complete either spec/11b_cat_spec.rb or spec/11c_dog_spec.rb

describe Dog do
  subject(:toby) { described_class.new('Toby', nil, 'brown') }

  # Before you begin this file, make sure you have read the shared
  # example file: 11a_shared_examples_spec.rb. This test references
  # that file's first test in the below 'include_examples' line.

# (see 11b_cat_spec.rb for Cat assignment)

  # Create a subject with your choice of dog name and optional breed/color.
