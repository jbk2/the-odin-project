# The file order to complete this lesson:

# 1. Familiarize yourself with the three lib/11 files.
#    - lib/11a_pet.rb is the parent 'Pet' class of 'Cat' and 'Dog'
#    - lib/11b_cat.rb is a subclass 'Cat'
#    - lib/11c_dog.rb is a subclass 'Dog'
# 2. Review the tests in spec/11a_shared_example_spec.rb
# 3. Complete either spec/11b_cat_spec.rb or spec/11c_dog_spec.rb

# Start with reading about the use of shared examples:
# https://web.archive.org/web/20230101143200/https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-core/docs/example-groups/shared-examples

# These tests are dependent on using the implicit 'subject' when they are
# included in another spec file. This file is not intended to be used alone.
# If you run rspec on this file, there will be 'no examples found' because
# there is not an implicit subject available.

RSpec.shared_examples 'base class method name' do
  # This test can be used in Cat and Dog because the method comes from the
  # base class.
  # https://web.archive.org/web/20230101143200/https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/v/3-9/docs/built-in-matchers/respond-to-matcher
  context 'when method is from the base class' do
    it 'responds to meal_time' do
      expect(subject).to respond_to(:meal_time)
    end
  end
end

RSpec.shared_examples 'shared method name' do
  # This test can be used in Cat and Dog because the same method name is used
  # in both classes ('meow' or 'WOOF!').
  context 'when method name is the same in multiple classes' do
    it 'responds to talk' do
      expect(subject).to respond_to(:talk)
    end
  end
end
