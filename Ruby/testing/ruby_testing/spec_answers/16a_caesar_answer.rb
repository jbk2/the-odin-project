# The file order to complete this lesson:

# 1. Familarize yourself with the four lib/16 files.
#    - lib/16_caesar_main
#    - lib/16a_caesar_breaker
#    - lib/16b_caesar_translator which is based on the typical Caesar Cipher
#    - lib/16c_database (module)
# 2. Check out the completed tests in spec/16b_caesar_translator.
# 3. Complete spec/16a_caesar_breaker_spec.

# The CaesarBreaker class creates the 26 possible translations (using the
# CaesarTranslator class) & saves them in a yaml file (using a Database module).

# Let's write tests for the CaesarBreaker class & the included Database module.

# In this lesson, you will be writing tests for 3 methods -
# #create_decrypted_messages, #save_decrypted_messages, and #save_to_yaml.
# In addition, you will learn about testing module methods and how to handle
# testing methods that can raise errors.

describe CaesarBreaker do
  # The tests for CaesarBreaker do not depend on creating different conditions.
  # Therefore we can use the same subject instance and CaesarTranslator double.

  subject(:phrase) { described_class.new('Lipps, Asvph!', translator) }
  let(:translator) { instance_double(CaesarTranslator) }

  describe '#decrypt' do
    # Public Script Method -> No test necessary, but all methods inside should
    # be tested.
  end

  # ASSIGNMENT #1

  # Write a test for the following method.
  describe '#create_decrypted_messages' do
    # This is a Looping Script Method.
    # Located inside #decrypt (Public Script Method)

    # Method with Outgoing Command -> Test that a message is sent

  # MODULE TESTING: There are several ways to test methods inside a module.
  # (The following methods are located in lib/16c_database.rb)

  # Some prefer explicitly including it in the configuration option.
  # https://web.archive.org/web/20230101143200/https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-core/docs/helper-methods/define-helper-methods-in-a-module

  # Some prefer testing modules using a dummy class.
